Fliler is an interactive file manager written in PHP5. It is currently unstable, but boasts an interesting array of half-implemented features, among them:

  * Support for transparent reading of ZIP-files as directories.
  * An incredibly verbose and useful directory reader.
  * A powerful library, which is slowly becoming its own class.
  * An experimental user account system.
