Notes about this repository: The current setup is far from stable, but still works fairly well for the most part. Remember that all code is licensed as GPLv3.

Further help is found in the help file! (https://code.google.com/p/fliler/source/browse/help.php or ./help.php)

## Requirements ##
1. 2MB of RAM is required for allocation for any part of Fliler to function, and 16MB should be satisfactory for everyday use.

2. At least 5MB should be available for the main software package, and additional space is recommended for other software which you may already have installed.

3. PHP, MySQL (not required by HIGHLY recommended)

## Setup ##
Unfortunately, the install script currently included is still a work-in-progress, and the one previously used privately is not available. As such, the only way to set things up is to follow the (admittedly poor) SQL structure documentation.
